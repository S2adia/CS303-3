# CS303-3
Q1: I have used cirular array to implement queue. The function definitions are in the AA3.h file and the function delacaration are in the AA3.cpp. Run the m.cpp file. I have pushed some integar values to the queue and all of the functions works correctly. Here's a screenshot of the output-

Q2: For part 2 I have modified the given source code (AA3-2.cpp) . The recursive function can handle cases where if the target item is not found it will return -1 and if the target item is found it will return the index of the last occurence of the targeted item. For my main function I have pushed some integar values to the vector and called the recursive function. Here's a screenshot of the output-

Q3: I have modified the source code from the lecture. I have added insert (to add items in the list) and display(print the items) functions for the list. Run the AA3-Q3.cpp file. I have inserted some integar values to the list. The program will perform insertion sort on the doubly linked list. Here's a screenshot of the output that prints the unsorted and sorted list after performing insertion sort-
